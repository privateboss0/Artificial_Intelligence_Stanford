# Artificial_Intelligence_Stanford assignment

The sentiment is the assignment folder: Kindly refer to https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2019/assignments/sentiment/index.html for the questions

#PS: The grader PSF(Python source file) is the math's to code for the sentiment analysis assignment

Here is a brief explanation of each problem:

Problem 1: This problem asks students to simulate stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and create a small dataset. SGD is an iterative algorithm for optimizing a function by taking small steps in the direction of the negative gradient.
Problem 2: This problem asks students to predict movie ratings using linear regression. Linear regression is a statistical model that can be used to predict a continuous variable (such as a movie rating) as a linear function of one or more other variables (such as the features of the movie).
Problem 3: This problem asks students to build a sentiment classifier to predict whether a piece of text is positive or negative. The classifier uses a variety of features, such as the presence of certain words or phrases, to make its prediction.
Problem 4: This problem asks students to implement the K-means clustering algorithm. K-means clustering is a machine learning algorithm that groups data points into K clusters based on their similarity.
